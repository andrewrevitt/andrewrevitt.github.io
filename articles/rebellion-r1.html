<p>You don't expect to see a Le Mans Prototype racecar up a mountain. On the way up to the small Swiss village of Villars, we found one parked in the middle of a grassy hairpin.</p>
<p>We are at 1300m, driving up a winding road that leads to the small resort of Villars in the picturesque Vaud Alps. It's summer and the sun is out. The Swiss are driving at their steady pace and cyclists toil on the steady climb. As we approach the outskirts of the village, lavish chalets dot the roadside and well-cut grass looks almost false on the many hairpin corners. Then there it is slap bang in the middle of a hairpin -  A Rebellion racing R-ONE LMP prototype race car.</p>
<p>No signs, no indication of what it is doing up here amongst the well-maintained foliage. We stop for a look and our interest seems to attract others. Even the cyclists stop for a selfie. The only obvious connection is this is the weekend of the mythic 24-hour race and Rebellion is a Swiss team - sort of. Rebellion Racing is a Swiss independent team with Oreca designed LMP cars racing in the FIA World Endurance Championship. Their sister company and sponsor is Rebellion timepieces. There is no motorsport in Switzerland except for the odd vintage car hill climb or rally. Perhaps the team owner lives in one of the multi-million chalets, or perhaps the sponsor does. Villars had no answers and neither did Google. Just another Swiss mystery.</p>
