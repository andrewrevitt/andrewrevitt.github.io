<p>You can spot nearly any car around the Monaco area - it's like catnip for supercars. Porsches 991 GT3RS is almost a common sight on the French Riviera but Martini painted ones are still a bit special.</p>
<p>The famous Martini stripes are a popular livery that first started back in 1968 and became famous in 1971 when a Martini striped Porsche 917 won the 24 Hours of Le Mans.</p>
<p>Martini & Rossi is a distillery that produces the Martini vermouth in Turin, Italy and was founded by Clemente Michel, Carlo Re, Carlo Agnelli and Eligio Baudino in 1847. A few years later Alessandro Martini joined the company as the director and was joined by the inventor of vermouth, Luigi Rossi.  In 1879 the Sola family sold its interests to the remaining partners, who renamed the company, Martini & Rossi.</p>
<p>Martini's sponsorship program began in 1958 as Martini International Club, but it was during the 1970s that Martini and Porsche joined forces winning the 1971, 1976 and 1977 24 Hours of Le Mans. Martini sponsored Porsches won many other events in the 1970s including the Porsche RSR in the Targa Florio.</p>
