<h3>A few kind words about my work</h3>
<blockquote>I've worked with Andrew on three projects now - he is a talented designer with a knack for great typography and imagery. He works very fast and quickly attains a clear understanding of the client's motivations and expectations.

<blockquote>I have worked with Andrew on a few projects now and have always valued his expertise and professionalism. Andrew delivers every project bang on time and puts in more than initially required.

<h6>Christian Redecen-Davies - thinklab</h6>

<blockquote>Even as I was writing the first few chapters of Depth Charge, Andrew reached out to provide incredibly kind encouragement and real world advice on publishing and promoting my novel. It was on his suggestion that I set up the Depth Charge website and collected contact information from interested readers.
