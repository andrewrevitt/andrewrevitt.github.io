<h1><a href="../index.html">Andrew Revitt</a></h1>
<p>I started in Information Technology before moving into design.</p>
<p>I developed one of the first mountain bike sites in 1998 and raced events like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megavalanche">Megavalanche</a>, <a href="https://www.saas-fee.ch/en/saas-valley/activities-events/top-events/glacier-bike-downhill/">Saas Fee Glacier bike</a> and the Torgonabike from 1997 to 2002.</p>
<p>I've worked for startups and design agencies and have been freelance since 2009.</p>
<p>I've lived in the UK, France and Switzerland and travelled extensively in the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>I'm currently taking on new work - please contact me on the links below.</p>

<h6>Design</h6>
<hr class="redline">
<p>I’ve created branding, graphic, print and web design for a wide variety of clients. I also developed an <a href="https://creativemarket.com/AR-Design-Studio">online store</a> for design resources and wrote a book on developing Tumblr themes. I am currently developing the <a href="https://superalpine.co">Super Alpine</a> brand and magazine.</p>
<p>I enjoy great typography, classic product design and some modern art. Some examples of this would be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_911">Porsche 911</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2Wvnyy4">Futura</a> &amp; Helvetica typefaces and the work of <a href="https://amzn.to/2WzjA7m">Damien Hirst</a>.</p>

<blockquote>I've worked with Andrew on three projects now - he is a talented designer with a knack for great typography and imagery. He works very fast and quickly attains a clear understanding of the client's motivations and expectations.<br><br>
For Sedex, he delivered an beautiful bootstrap-based style that incorporated an existing logo yet transformed the visual identity of the organisation. It has received a great deal of positive feedback from Sedex staff and members around the world.<br><br>
Andrew was happy to join our development team on site, and also worked remotely with the front end developer to implement, extend and adapt the style as new functionality was delivered. The application is complex, but Andrew got up to speed with our AngularJS front end and continuous integration pipeline very quickly.<br><br>
I would not hesitate to contact Andrew for any piece of digital design work - from a logo to a full application style, and I have recommended him to others on a number of occasions.
