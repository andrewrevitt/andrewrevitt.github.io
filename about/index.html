	<blockquote>I've worked with Andrew on three projects now - he is a talented designer with a knack for great typography and imagery. He works very fast and quickly attains a clear understanding of the client's motivations and expectations.<br><br>
	For Sedex, he delivered an beautiful bootstrap-based style that incorporated an existing logo yet transformed the visual identity of the organisation. It has received a great deal of positive feedback from Sedex staff and members around the world.<br><br>
	Andrew was happy to join our development team on site, and also worked remotely with the front end developer to implement, extend and adapt the style as new functionality was delivered. The application is complex, but Andrew got up to speed with our AngularJS front end and continuous integration pipeline very quickly.<br><br>
	I would not hesitate to contact Andrew for any piece of digital design work - from a logo to a full application style, and I have recommended him to others on a number of occasions.
	<br><br><h6>Tom Cunliffe - Sedex</h6>
	<br><br><hr><br>I have worked with Andrew on a few projects now and have always valued his expertise and professionalism. Andrew delivers every project bang on time and puts in more than initially required - I will be working with Andrew in the future and highly recommend his services to anyone.
